<!-- SECTION 1: Introduction -->
<section id="introduction">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
        SpendWise is a native Android application designed to bring financial wellness by combining
        expense tracking with social accountability. Unlike traditional budgeting tools—which can often
        feel isolating or overly complex—SpendWise integrates personal finance management with
        “Savings Circles,” a collaborative feature where users can work together with friends to achieve
        shared financial goals.
    </p>

    <p>
        Built using the MVVM architecture, the application leverages Firebase Firestore for real-time
        cloud synchronization and authentication. Some of our key features include:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Smart Expense Logging:</strong> A simple interface for tracking daily spending with category-based organization.</li>
        <li><strong>Interactive Dashboards:</strong> Real-time data visualizations powered by MPAndroidChart, including dynamic pie and bar charts.</li>
        <li><strong>Social Savings:</strong> A unique “Savings Circle” system that provides collaborative saving challenges and progress tracking.</li>
        <li><strong>AI-Powered Guidance:</strong> An integrated AI chatbot that offers personalized budgeting tips, answers FAQs, and provides motivation.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        SpendWise transforms the tedious task of budgeting into an engaging and social experience,
        helping users develop healthier money habits while staying accountable through collaboration.

    <p>
        Throughout the SpendWise Finance App Project, our team learned a lot about the overall functionality
        of what goes into the front and backend of a fully functional app. We also learned a lot about common behavioral practices that go into
        working with group of people who specialize in different areas. As the project started off and progressed, each sprint
        became more and more challenging, but with thorough communication between the team, and properly divided tasks based on each members
        interests, we were able to complete the demands of each sprint.

        Neel handled most of the the firebase work early on, including the 
        authentication, storing the user data, expenses, budgets, and setting up the database structure the app heavily relied on throughout the project.
        He also worked on implementing the savings circle group invitation process and helped implement the notification system for the app. Ashwanth was responsible for the overall architecture of the app, making sure 
        the MVVM model was sustained, produced many of the major deliverable diagrams, the dashoboard charts that displayed the breakdown of budgets and expenses, and implementing the AI chatbot feature for the app using Ollama while handling
        API calls, real-time streaming, and generating AI based messages and summaries of the users interaction with the app. Smitha focused more on the UI creation
        including building the expense creation form, designing savings circle, and the user profile tab along with the additional adding friends feature. Kushi also worked on multiple
        key UI features like the budgets screen and budgets creation, saving circle details and proper validation towards creating savings circle, and the dark mode toggle. Sri worked on setting the app's splash screen up in beginning, 
        added the calendar feature which allowed the app to keep track of real dates, which played a key role in all date related features such as budgets, expenses, and savings circles. He also worked on implementing the savings circle period feature,
        and ensured that all of the data affected by the global date remained linked and fucntional. Ved worked on the navigation bar which managed the overall navigation of the app to different features.
        Ved also built the budget calculator, expanded the expense log to support savings circle contributions, integrated group goals inot the budgets screen and 
        worked with Neel to finalize the notification system for budget and expense log warnings.
    </p>

    <p>
        With all of the tasks mentioned above, the biggest challenge we faced was related to time. Along with the app functionality we were
        also expected to create design diagrams deliverables which would take longer than expected. Savings Circle logic with the date joined and overall period
        functionality and the app date feature both were more complicated than expected as well, creating unforseen delays. However, with proper communication
        and the adaptive nature of spreading the work out accordingly based on which team member is struggling with their work, we were able to combat such problems effectively.
    </p>

    <p>
        As a team, we learned a lot about the process of developing a functional app using Android Studio, the MVVM structure,
        firestore integration, the UI design elements, and many other coding principles such as Design Patterns and GRASP Principles. The team also gained
        experience in using Github, learning skills such as cloning repositories, creating and merging branches, fixing merge conlficts and creating PRs. We also used
        online work management software such as Jira to help manage our tasks for each sprint. Overall, this project was very helpful in developing technical and behavioral 
        skills that are very relevant to industry standards, and allowed us to create a working and meaningful app.
