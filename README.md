# Spendwise

SpendWise is a native Android application designed to bring financial wellness by combining expense tracking with social accountability. Unlike traditional budgeting tools—which can often feel isolating or overly complex—SpendWise integrates personal finance management with “Savings Circles,” a collaborative feature where users can work together with friends to achieve shared financial goals.

Built using the MVVM architecture, the application leverages Firebase Firestore for real-time cloud synchronization and authentication. Some of our key features include:

- Smart Expense Logging: A simple interface for tracking daily spending with category-based organization.
- Interactive Dashboards: Real-time data visualizations powered by MPAndroidChart, including dynamic pie and bar charts.
- Social Savings: A unique “Savings Circle” system that provides collaborative saving challenges and progress tracking.
- AI-Powered Guidance: An integrated AI chatbot that offers personalized budgeting tips, answers FAQs, and provides motivation.

SpendWise transforms the tedious task of budgeting into an engaging and social experience, helping users develop healthier money habits while staying accountable through collaboration.
